This repository hosts the code for a spatiotemporal modeling framework (GAM, generalised additive models) designed to analyse and predict antimicrobial resistance (AMR)
trends using longitudinal data from Pfizerâ€™s ATLAS database. Our project harnesses advanced GAMs to assess pathogen-specific AMR prevalence and growth rates across various 
antibiotic categories, as prioritised by the WHO. By detecting critical changes in AMR spread, our approach enhances the ability to forecast AMR dynamics accurately, supporting 
policymakers in formulating and adjusting AMR National Action Plans effectively. The provided methodology aims to refine AMR monitoring and forecasting at both national and subgroup 
levels, fostering timely interventions to reduce AMR threats.
